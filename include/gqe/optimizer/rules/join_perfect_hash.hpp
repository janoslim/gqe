/**
 * @brief This rule inspects each logical `join_relation` and enables perfect hashing when the
 * equi-join keys on one (or both) sides cover a primary key or unique key.
 *
 * - Uniqueness information is derived from each side's `unique_keys()` relation properties,
 *   which are populated by the `uniqueness_propagation` rule. This rule must therefore run after
 *   `uniqueness_propagation`.
 * - Only inner joins with a pure equi-join predicate are eligible.
 * - The rule sets `join_relation::_perfect_hash_policy` to `left`, `right`, or `either`
 *   depending on which side's join keys are unique. The physical plan builder (`plan_join.cpp`)
 *   maps this to an actual `perfect_hashing` flag only when the unique side is also the build
 *   (broadcast) side.
 * - NULL_EQUALS predicates (IS NOT DISTINCT FROM) are excluded: a nullable UNIQUE column permits
 *   multiple NULL rows, so perfect hashing on NULL-equal keys could map different NULL rows to
 *   the same slot and produce incorrect results.
 * - LIMITATION: the rule does not verify that the join-key columns are non-nullable.
 *   `libperfect::perfect_join` requires *both* sides' keys to contain no nulls and throws
 *   otherwise. A SQL UNIQUE key may itself be nullable, and the probe side is unchecked. This is
 *   tracked as a follow-up; until non-null propagation exists, eligibility relies on the join keys
 *   being non-null in practice. See issue #404.
