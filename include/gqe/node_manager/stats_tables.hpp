 *
 * GQE maintains per-table compression statistics in the node manager's catalog. To make them
 * accessible to clients (e.g. `gqe-cli` / `gqe-python`) that can only issue SQL, the statistics are
 * projected into two regular tables, `_gqe_table_stats` and `_gqe_column_stats`, which clients
 * query with ordinary `SELECT` statements. The tables use `boost_shared` storage (host-shared,
 * uncompressed) so the task managers that execute the read can map and read them.
 *
 * This header is the single source of truth for the two tables' names and column schemas; both
 * registration (here) and projection/materialization of their contents refer to these schemas so
 * the column order stays consistent.
